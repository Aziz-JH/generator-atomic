# generator-atomic

> This [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator scaffolds an atomic-design templating framework based on the markup language [Jade](http://http://jade-lang.com/).
> It comes bundled with [BabelJS](http://babeljs.io/) for ES6 support, [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), ESLint and a build-in Livereload Server. 
> Several Subgenerators (atom, molecule, organism...) help you during your project to quickly add new modules and link them properly.
> [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) helps you to automate your workflow with several helpful tasks like "build", "release" and "serve" (default)
